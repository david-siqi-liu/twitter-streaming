Our project will be the type 2 as described in the course webpage.

"Learn and explore a (new) big data processing framework: 
although we discussed a variety of processing frameworks in class, 
the assignments focused on MapReduce and Spark. Here's your chance to learn a new processing framework, 
e.g., Spark Streaming, GraphX, Giraph, Flink, etc. 
The project would involve learning to use the processing framework and doing something interesting with it. 
The "something interesting" might be a data mining algorithm, 
although note that the expectations would be lower than building something in MapReduce or Spark, 
since learning the new framework would form an essential component of the project."

We are learning Apache Flink and we plan to do stream-processing twitter data.
